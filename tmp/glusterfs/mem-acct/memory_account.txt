                          GlusterFS Memory Accounting

Abstract
--------
This document briefly explains the memory accounting infrastructure in
GlusterFS.

Introduction
------------
GlusterFS keeps an account of the amount of memory used by the xlators,
libraries, and other core components. This information is used to detect and
debug memory issues in the filesystem.
      Memory accounting is enabled by default in GlusterFS, unless explicitly
disabled.

The Data Structures
-------------------
GlusterFS makes use of two structures `mem_acct' and `mem_acct_rec' to keep
track of the memory allocations.

struct mem_acct {
    uint32_t num_types;
    gf_atomic_t refcnt;
    struct mem_acct_rec rec[0];
};

struct mem_acct_rec {
    const char *typestr;
    uint64_t size;
    uint64_t max_size;
    uint64_t total_allocs;
    uint32_t num_allocs;
    uint32_t max_num_allocs;
    gf_lock_t lock;
#ifdef DEBUG
    struct list_head obj_list;
#endif
};


The Data Structure Initialization
---------------------------------

xlator_mem_acct_init / default_mem_acct_init:
    The function xlator_mem_acct_init allocates and initializes memory of the
    size mem_acct + (mem_acct_rec * num_allocs), where num_allocs is an enum
    indicating how many mem_acct_rec structures have to be allocated.

As the name suggets xlator_mem_acct_init is called by the xlators and one of the
parameters is the pointer to the xlator. Upon allocating memory the pointer to
the allocated memory is stored in xlator->mem_acct.

xlator_t->mem_acct_init
    Every xlator should call the xlator_mem_acct_init with its corresponding
    num_allocs. The mem_acct_init is part of xlator API, the function pointer is
    assigned xlator_t->mem_acct_init member. For example quick-read translator
    has the function qr_mem_acct_init which calls xlator_mem_acct_init, the
    pointer of qr_mem_acct_init is assigned to xlator_t->mem_acct_init.

The function gf_mem_acct_enable_set is called from the cli or the api to enable
the memory accounting (if it was explictly disabled while starting glusterfs).

The variable gf_global_mem_acct_enable is set to 1 to enable memory accounting.

The function gf_global_mem_acct_enable_set is the same as gf_mem_acct_enable_set
but only that it takes an integer value.

The function gf_global_mem_acct_enable_get returns the current value of
gf_global_mem_acct_enable.

The function gf_check_and_set_mem_acct is called in the glusterfsd main
function, this fuction checks the cli option --no-mem-accounting to unset memory
accounting.




Notes:

* gf_global_mem_acct_enable is the global variable which is set if enabled.
* Can the data collected by the memory accounting infrastructure can be dumped by
  sending the USR1 signal to the glusterfs(d) process?
