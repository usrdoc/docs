                          GlusterFS Memory Accounting

Abstract
--------
This document briefly explains the memory accounting infrastructure in
GlusterFS.

Introduction
------------
GlusterFS keeps an account of the amount of memory used by the xlators,
libraries, and other core components. This information is used to detect and
debug memory issues in the filesystem.
      Memory accounting is enabled by default in GlusterFS, unless explicitly
disabled.

The Data Structures
-------------------
GlusterFS makes use of two structures `mem_acct' and `mem_acct_rec' to keep
track of the memory allocations.

struct mem_acct {
    uint32_t num_types;
    gf_atomic_t refcnt;
    struct mem_acct_rec rec[0];
};

struct mem_acct_rec {
    const char *typestr;
    uint64_t size;
    uint64_t max_size;
    uint64_t total_allocs;
    uint32_t num_allocs;
    uint32_t max_num_allocs;
    gf_lock_t lock;
#ifdef DEBUG
    struct list_head obj_list;
#endif
};


The Data Structure Initialization
---------------------------------

xlator_mem_acct_init / default_mem_acct_init:
    The function xlator_mem_acct_init allocates and initializes memory of the
    size mem_acct + (mem_acct_rec * num_allocs), where num_allocs is an enum
    indicating how many mem_acct_rec structures have to be allocated.

The function xlator_mem_acct_init is called by all the xlators, and one of the
parameters to the function xlator_mem_acct_init is the pointer to the
xlator. Upon allocating memory the pointer to the allocated memory is stored in
xlator->mem_acct.

xlator_t->mem_acct_init
    Every xlator should call the xlator_mem_acct_init with its corresponding
    num_allocs. The mem_acct_init is part of xlator API, the function pointer is
    assigned xlator_t->mem_acct_init member. For example quick-read translator
    has the function qr_mem_acct_init which in turn calls xlator_mem_acct_init,
    the pointer of qr_mem_acct_init is assigned to xlator_t->mem_acct_init.

gf_mem_acct_enable_set
    Is called from the cli or the api to enable the memory accounting (if it was
    explictly disabled while starting glusterfs).

gf_global_mem_acct_enable_set
    Assigns 1 to the global variable gf_global_mem_acct_enable to enable memory
    accounting.

gf_mem_acct_enable_set
    Sets glusterfs_ctx_t->mem_acct_enable to 1.

gf_global_mem_acct_enable_get
    Returns the current value of gf_global_mem_acct_enable.

gf_check_and_set_mem_acct
    Is called in the glusterfsd main function, this fuction checks the cli
    option --no-mem-accounting to unset memory accounting. Note that memory
    accounting is enabled by default.

gf_mem_set_acct_info
    This function is called by GF_MALLOC and GF_CALLOC. This is the function
    which does the actual book keeping. Updates the structure mem_acct_rec with
    the number of allocations this time and total number of allocations.

gf_mem_update_acct_info
    This function is called by GF_REALLOC, this doesn't change the number of
    allcoations but just the total allocations.

gf_mem_header_prepare


Notes:

* gf_global_mem_acct_enable is the global variable which is set if enabled.
* Can the data collected by the memory accounting infrastructure can be dumped by
  sending the USR1 signal to the glusterfs(d) process?
