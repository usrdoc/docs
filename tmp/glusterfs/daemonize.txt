                     Understanding the daemonize() function

glusterfs_pidfile_setup(ctx)
    Just open the ctx->cmd_args->pid_file and store the FILE pointer in
    ctx->pidfp.

Creates a pipe (ctx->daemon_pipe)
    Where (ctx->daemon_pipe: int daemon_pipe[2])
    

If --no-daemon or --debug option is provided, the pid file updated (if
provided), timer event is created, and signals are setup.

The functions gf_log_inject_timer_event() and glusterfs_signals_setup create two
threads:

1. timer event thread, which runs the function: gf_timer_proc(void *data)
     This thread flushes the log after every 120ms and restarts the thread.
2. signals thread, which runs the function: glusterfs_sigwaiter(void *arg)
     Sets up signals and waits forever for SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGINT, ...
