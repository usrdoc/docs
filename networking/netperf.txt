* How to measure the network performance?

Indicators - Latency, Throughput

Latency - (One way, round trip)
   - Time taken to transmit a packet across the network.
   - What impacts latency? (Any element in the chain?)

Throughput - Quantity of data sent/received in a given time frame(?)

Transferring files to test network speed is a bad idea. Why?
