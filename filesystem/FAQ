1. What are different file types in Unix?
    - Regular file
    - Directory
    - FIFO
    - Character Special
    - Block Special
    - Symbolic link
    - Hard link (There is no difference between a regular file and hardlink)
    - Socket

2. What happens when a hard link is created for a symbolic link?
   Another file(symlink) is created with link count set to 2. And the old
   symlink's link count will be set to 2 as well.

3. How many hard links can be created for a file in a given directory?
   Linux uses unsigned int 32 to store the number of links. So it is 2^32 - 1
   files. Or the number of directory entries a directory supports?
