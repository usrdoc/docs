Some notes on POSIX threads

Two types of thread initialization
    * Statically -- pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
    * dynamically -- pthread_mutex_init(3)

* Mutexes just serialize (pthread_mutex_t)
* Waiting problem is solved by condition variables (pthread_cond_t -- Wait and
                                                    signal)

On "thread-safe"
  * Routines with no restrictions on how the threads should be used.
